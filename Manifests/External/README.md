# Why External Resources?
This folder contains manifests for in-cluster resources related to external nodes. This is usually done for pointing loging resources within kubernetes at other nodes outside of the cluster.


## Note
The Kubernetes cluster IS NOT reponsible for standing up any of these resources. Use another configuration tool like Ansible if you'd like to configure your infrustructure.
